# Motion

Motion can be a great way to guide people through a process. However, it should be used carefully so as to not distract or create anxiety. It should also be optional for users who have vestibular disorders and eplilepsy that can be triggered by animation. 

Accessibility and Usability

- All animations should meet Success Criterion 2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below Threshold of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
- Animation-triggered seizures, migraines, vertigo, etc. are highly nuanced. Thus, designers should always design both an animated and non-animated version of any animated designs they create. 
- The non-animated design should be implemented by a developer within the CSS using prefers-reduced-motion.
