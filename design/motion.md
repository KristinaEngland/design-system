# Motion

Motion can be a great way to guide people through a process. However, it should be used carefully so as to not distract or create anxiety. It should also be optional for users who have vestibular disorders and eplilepsy that can be triggered by animation. 

## Motion Best Practices
- Motion should have a purpose. Consider the following questions:
  - What problem is motion solving?
  - How does it enhance the user's understanding?
- All motion should adhere to Success Criterion 2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below Threshold of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
- People should always be given the option to opt out of motion. Motion can trigger seizures, vertigo, migranes, etc. and the triggers can be highly individualized so designers should always design both a motion experience and non-motion experience and ensure a developer implements the non-motion experience through CSS prefers-reduced-motion.
