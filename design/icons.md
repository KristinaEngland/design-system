# Icons

Icons are visual symbols that draw attention to important parts of a web page, reinforce a brand, and can break down language barriers. 

## Icon Best Practices
- Icons should always be a solid, monochromatic color and need to pass the same color contrast ratio as typography (4.5:1). 
- All touch targets for interactive icons need to be 44px or larger. This includes your mobile menu icon.
- If pairing with text:
  - Do match your icon color with your text color.
  - Center align the icon.
