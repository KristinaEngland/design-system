# Icons

Icons are visual symbols that draw attention to important parts of a web page, reinforce a brand, and can break down language barriers. 

## Icon Best Practices
- Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action. There should always be an actionable reason for the icon - if there isn't, that means it will add no value to the page and shouldn't be used. 
- Icons should always be a solid, monochromatic color and need to pass the same color contrast ratio as typography (4.5:1). 
- All touch targets for interactive icons need to be 44px or larger. This includes your mobile menu icon.
- If pairing with text:
  - Do match your icon color with your text color.
  - Center align the icon.
