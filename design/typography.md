# Typography

## Headings
### Accessibility and Usability
- All headings should be written in sentence case.
- Always use built in heading styles and ensure they are nested correctly (i.e. if you are using a Heading 3, there must be a corresponding Heading 2 - if there isn't, that heading should be a Heading 2)..

### Typeface
All headings should use the [Montserrat font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).

### Font Size, Weight, and Color

- Heading 1: 55px/3.4375rem, 900 weight, #FFFFFF over colors, #1D1E1F over white
- Heading 2: 42px/2.625rem, 700 weight, #353535
- Heading 3: 35px/2.1875rem, 500 weight, #1D1E1F 
- Heading 4: 24px/1.5rem, 500 weight, #1D1E1F

## Paragraphs

### Body
- All body content should use the [Open Sans font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).
- The default paragraph font size is * Tracy to add font size information *

### Lead paragraph
All pages have one optional lead paragraph available to use as your introductory paragraph. 
- If used, this lead paragraph should summarize the content on the page. 
- The lead paragraph uses * Tracy to add font size information *

### Style Guidelines
- All bulleted content should use built-in ordered and unordered bullet styles.
- Use bold to emphasize content.
- Do not change built-in font colors if you have access to do so - we can not look down all systems. 
- Text alignment should remain at the default of aligned-left, which is the most readable alignment.
