# Checkboxes

Checkboxes are used when you want a user to be able to select one or more options in a list. 

## When to Use
- When you want users to have the ability to select more than one item in a list.
- For Forms, Filtering and Batch Actions, and for Terms and Conditions.

## When not to Use
- When a user is only allowed to select one option. In this case, you would use a radio button component.

## Accessibility and Usability
- Each checkbox should be reachable by tabbing and should be able to be selected with the space key and with speech recognition commands. 
- Group checkboxes together in a <fieldset> with a <legend> that describes them. Ensure the accessible name meets the WCAG's Success Criterion 2.5.3: Label in Name.
- If your checkboxes are displayed across multiple columns, ensure they retain a meaningful order for keyboard only and screen reader users.
