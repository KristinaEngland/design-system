# Toggle
Toggle switches allow users to switch between on and off settings. They are most often seen in user preferences for systems. There is always a default setting, which should be established during the design phase. In addition, you can leverage a user's system preferences to determine what the default is when they create an account in the system. For example, if a user already has a system preference to reduce preferred motion, you can configure the user preference for animations to respect their system preference and shut off animations for that user.
