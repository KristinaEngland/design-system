# Toggle
Toggle switches allow users to switch between on and off settings. They are most often seen in user preferences for systems. There is always a default setting, which should be established during the design phase. In addition, you can leverage a user's system preferences to determine what the default is when they create an account in the system. For example, if a user already has a system preference to reduce preferred motion, you can configure the toggle switch to change based on their system preferences so that the user doesn't need to manually change the default setting.
