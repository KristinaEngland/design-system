# When Not to Use

# Accessibility and Usability
- The visible label for the Select component should match the behind the scenes label to ensure the label works with all types of assistive technology. See WCAG Label in Name for more details.
- The label should not be placed inside the Select component - placeholders are never a substitute for labels as they can cause issues with assistive technology as well as be hugely problematic for anyone with cognitive or memory issues.
- Provide real time validation and ensure any errors are coded to be read by assistive technology.
- Ensure the select component is both usable with a mouse and keyboard. 
- If the Selec component has an autocomplete look up, ensure the search results are being read to screen reader users and that the results are reachable by keyboard and mouse.
