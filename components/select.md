# When Not to Use

# Accessibility and Usability
- The visible label for the Select component should match the behind the scenes label to ensure the label works with all types of assistive technology. See WCAG Label in Name for more details.
- The label should not be placed inside the Select component - placeholders are never a substitute for labels as they can cause issues with assistive technology as well as be hugely problematic for anyone with cognitive or memory issues.
