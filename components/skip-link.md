# Skip Link
A link at the top of the page that visually appears on the first keyboard tab into the page. This link allows anyone using keyboard-only navigation or a screen reader to jump over the navigation links and land on the main content of the page. Most beneficial to the keyboard-only community as there is no other way to skip to the main content while screen reader users can use landmarks, headings, and other shortcuts to jump down the page.
