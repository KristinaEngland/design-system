# Accordion

## When to Use

- When you have a lot of related supplemental content to convey on one page; and
- You want to give users the ability to select which content to expand and review.

## When Not to Use
- When you need users to read all the content on the page. 
- When the content isn't related and should be different pages to improve both usability and searchability. 

## Accessibility and Usability
- Users should have the ability to expand as many accordions as they want - expanding one accordion should not collapse another accordion. 
- Accordions should have clear focus indicators on hover and on keyboard focus. 
- Accordions should show a plus sign when collapsed and a minus sign when expanded.
- Screen reader users should be alerted to the fact that they have expanded an accordion successfully.
