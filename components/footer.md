#  Footer Component

The website footer is the section of content at the very bottom of a web page. It typically contains a copyright notice, link to a privacy policy, sitemap, logo, contact information, social media icons, and an email sign-up form. In short, a footer contains information that improves a websiteâ€™s overall usability.

## When to Use

- Every page on a website should contain the footer at the bottom of it.

## Accessibility and Usability

- Focus Indicator is the same for a mouse hover or keyboard focus.
- Text in the footer is read by screen readers and can be selected with a mouse.
- Text in the footer should be short and easily scannable.


## HTML and CSS

### Basic Footer without Links
This footer can be used on marketing campaign sites and other simple sites that do not require a robust footer.

Add codepen.

### Footer with Links

There are two standard links that should be added to all main websites - (1) Terms of Use/Privacy Policy and (2) Accessibility.
