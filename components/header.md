#  Header Component

The website header is the section of content at the top of a web page. Headers will typically include a logo, some text, navigation elements, and a search bar.

## When to Use

 There should be a header at the top of every page on a website.

## Accessibility and Usability

- Always include a Skip to main content link. See the Skip to main content link component for how to implement that function. 
- Include the proper landmarks (banner, search, navigation).
- The header logo should include the name of the site for its alt text (for example, UMass Office of the President).
