# Video Embed
The video embed component allows someone to embed a video from either Brightcove or YouTube on to a page. The component requires a transcript be uploaded with the video to ensure accessible communications. There is no way to require captions on the component side - this must be handled through the Brightcove or YouTube interface. 

## When to Use
- For any videos being added to Massachusetts.edu or UMassp.edu. 

## When Not to Use
- Not applicable. 

## Accessibility and Usability
- The embedded video should work with both voice input (speech recognition) and screen reader software.
- The transcript field should be required and allow for either a text file or html file upload. 
- The video should never auto-play due to the fact that an auto-playing video will interfer with both speech recognition and screen reader software.
