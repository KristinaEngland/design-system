# Modal Dialog
Modal dialogs are pop-up windows that disrupt the flow of what a user is doing and demand an action. They are appropriate when the user’s attention needs to be directed toward important information that cannot be conveyed within the page.

## When to use
As documented by the Nielsen Norman Group, modal dialogs should be used in the following cases, for content that requires interrupting a user's workflow:
- Use modal dialogs for important warnings, as a way to prevent or correct critical errors.
- Use modal dialogs to request the user to enter information critical to continuing the current process.
- Use modal dialogs to ask for information that, when provided, could significantly lessen users’ work or effort.

## When not to use
- Do not use modal dialogs for nonessential information that is not related to the current user flow.
- Avoid modal dialogs that interrupt high-stake processes such as checkout flows.
- Avoid modal dialogs for complex decision making that requires additional sources of information unavailable in the modal.
