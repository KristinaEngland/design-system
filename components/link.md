# Link

## When to Use
- To navigate to another page on the current site or to content on another site.
- To link to email addresses and phone numbers.
- To provide an anchor link to content on the same page.
- To link to a downloadable document. 

## When Not to Use
Links should not be used for actions that will change data or manipulate how it is displayed, change a state, or trigger an action. [Buttons](https://kristinaengland.github.io/design-system/components/button) should be used instead. 

## Accessibility and Usability Best Practices
- Links should be descriptive, indicating where the user will be sent. Never use click here, read more, or learn more.
- Links should always be underlined.
- Links should have focus indicators both on hover and on keyboard focus. 
- Links should not open in a new window. Users should be allowed the choice of whether to open the link in a new window. If a use case requires the link to open in a new window, the user must be alerted that it will be opened in a new window. 
- Document links should be appended with the document file type in parentheses and the file type should be included in the descriptive hyperlink. For Example, Email Policy (PDF).
