# Radio Buttons

## When to Use
- When the selection of a value is required. See "When Not to Use" for the issue of using this type of form field for non-required questions.

## When Not to Use
- When the selection of a value is not required. In this case, you should use a dropdown list instead. Otherwise, users could accidentally select a value when completing a form. There is no way to unselect a radio button value once one is selected without refreshing the form and losing valueable data.

## Accessibility and Usability
- Ensure a radio button is selected by default so that users know they must have one selected. Not setting this expectation through a default value causes frustration for the user if they accidentally select a non-required radio value as then the only way to deselect it is to refresh the form and lose other valuable data inputs.
