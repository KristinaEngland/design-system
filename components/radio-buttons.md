# Radio Buttons

## When to Use
- When the user can only select one value, and
- When the selection of a value is required. 

## When Not to Use
- When the selection of a value is optional. In this case, you should use a dropdown list instead. Otherwise, users could accidentally select a value when completing a form. There is no way to unselect a radio button value once one is selected without refreshing the form and losing valueable data.
- When the user needs to select multiple values. In this case, you would use the checkbox component.
