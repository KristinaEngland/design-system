# Notification Banner
A notification gives people timely, high-value information they can understand at a glance and easily dismiss. Per Nielsen Norman Group, there are two types of notifications:
1. Action-required notifications alert the user of an event that requires a user action. In this sense, they are similar to validation, but since they were not sparked by the userâ€™s own action, they require a different design.  
2. Passive notifications, which are informational; they report a system occurrence that does not require any user action.  Many notifications in mobile apps are passive: they usually announce an event of potential interest to the user.
