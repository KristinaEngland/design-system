# Notification Banner
A notification gives people timely, high-value information they can understand at a glance and easily dismiss. Per Nielsen Norman Group, there are two types of notifications:
1. Action-required notifications alert the user of an event that requires a user action. In this sense, they are similar to validation, but since they were not sparked by the user’s own action, they require a different design.  
2. Passive notifications, which are informational; they report a system occurrence that does not require any user action.  Many notifications in mobile apps are passive: they usually announce an event of potential interest to the user.

## When to use
- To announce an event that has some significance to the user.
  - Use action-required notifications when an announcement is urgent and should be intrusive, such as a system downtime alert or when an immediate software update is required due to a security vulnerability. 
  - Use passive notifications for information that is not urgent and thus should be less intrusive. This might be a reminder to run a software update or of an upcoming deadline. Note that passive notifications are easily missed so finding other ways to convey that content such as through a customer email are recommended. 

## When not to use
- They are not triggered by users’ immediate actions. Do not use for error messages. Use an alert component instead. 

## Accessibility and Usability
- Provide concise, informative notifications.
