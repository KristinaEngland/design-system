# Error Messages
Error messages appear after someone has taken an action and alert the person of an error that has occured in their action. For example, if someone tries to submit a form without filling out a required field, an error message would alert them of the fact they forgot to complete a field and what field they forgot to complete. 

## When to Use
- Error messages should be used for form validation.
- For service status messages such as errors and warnings. 

## When Not to Use
- To confirm the deletion or cancelation of data - instead, use a modal dialogue message to confirm the user action.

## Accessibility and Usability
- Ensure there is an explicit indication that something has gone wrong. 
- Always follow plain language guidelines when writing custom error messages - the error message must be easy for all users to understand.  
- Visual design should include both an error icon and an error color to convey meaning. 
- The error message must be coded to receive focus by assistive technology when triggered.
