# Side Navigation

Create a vertical list of navigation links for use in a sidebar 

## When to Use
- When sub-content on a site requires it's own menu. For example, a department site with several main page and sub-pages that would not fit into the main navigation of the site. 

## When Not to Use
- For sub-content that does not have multiple pages of content.

## Accessibility and Usability

- Navigation components should have clearly defined Navigation landmarks behind the scenes. The Sub navigation should thus have a clear landmark name to delinate it from the main navigation of the site, such as "Section Pages" or "In this Section."
