# Navigation

Navigation components offer a persistent and convenient way to switch between primary destinations on a website or product. They provide top-level destinations that need to be easily reachable and can also provide sub-menu items. You may have only one navigation bar or you may have multiple, such as the common three navigation elements set up for complex sites - main navigation, side navigaion, and utility navigation.

## Accessibility and Usability

- Navigation components should have clearly defined Navigation landmarks behind the scenes. When there is only one navigation component, you can leave the navigation landmark default name of navigation. When there are multiple navigation components, you should make clear what each one does, such as Main Navigation and Utility Navigation.
