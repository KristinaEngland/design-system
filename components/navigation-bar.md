# Side Navigation

Create a vertical list of navigation links for use in a sidebar 

## When to Use
- When sub-content on a site requires it's own menu. For example, a department site with several main page and sub-pages that would not fit into the main navigation of the site. 

## When Not to Use
- For sub-content that does not have multiple pages of content.

## Accessibility and Usability

- Navigation components should have clearly defined Navigation landmarks behind the scenes. When there is only one navigation component, you can leave the navigation landmark default name of navigation. When there are multiple navigation components, you should make clear what each one does, such as Main Navigation and Utility Navigation.
