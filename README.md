# UMass President's Office Design System

This design system provides a standard way for designers and developers at the UMass President's Office to implement styles, components, and patterns. The design system will expand over time and some content may change based on user experience research. Releases will be communicated accordingly.

## Instructions for developing new pages

### General Structure
- When creating a new file, the name of the file should reflect the name of the Git Hub page with an .md extension at the end. For example, button.md. 
- The name of the page should be added as a Heading 1 (which is # in GitHub Markup).

### Component Pages
- All Component pages should have the following sections, which should be Heading 2s (## in GitHub Markup):
  - When to use
  - When not to use
  - Accessibility and Usability
  - HTML and CSS
- Any code added to a Component page should be embedded as a Pen from the team's CodePen account.
