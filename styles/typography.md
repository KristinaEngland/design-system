# Typography

## Headings
### Typeface
All headings should use the Montserrat font.

### Font Size and Color

- Heading 1: 
- Heading 2:
- Heading 3:
- Heading 4:

## Body Content 
### Typeface
All body content should use the Open Sans font.

### Style Guidelines
- All bulleted content should use built-in ordered and unordered bullet styles.
- Use bold to emphasize content.
- Do not change built-in font colors if you have access to do so - we can not look down all systems. 
- Text alignment should remain at the default of aligned-left, which is the most readable alignment.
